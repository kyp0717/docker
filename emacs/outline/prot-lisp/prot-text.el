(defun prot-text-insert-heading (&optional arg)
  "Insert equal length heading delimiter below current line.

A heading delimiter is drawn as a series of dashes (-).  With
optional ARG, i.e. by prefixing \\[universal-argument], draw the
heading delimiter with equals signs (=).  The latter is
considered a heading level 1, while the former is level 2.

A heading delimiter is inserted only when that would not mess up
with existing headings or lists.  In such cases, point will move
to the next line.  For the purposes of this command, text that
starts with a number and no further delimiter is not consider a
list element.

This command is meant to be used in Text mode buffers and
compatible derivatives, such as Markdown mode, though not Org
mode which has its own conventions."
